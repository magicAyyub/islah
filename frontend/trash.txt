I built the backend of a school management system. I want you to build the frontend. I have created a Next.js application, installed shadcn, and also installed at the same level acernity UI. I want something clean, modern, and intuitive. The backend is made with FastAPI, offering endpoints in JSON format.

Here are the endpoints of the backend:

/students : Get Students
/students/{student_id} : Get Student by ID
/students : Create Student
/students/{student_id} : Update Student
/students/{student_id} : Delete Student
/students/degree/{degree_id} : Get Students by Degree ID
/students/classroom/{classroom_id} : Get Students by Classroom ID
/students/mentor/{mentor_id} : Get Students by Mentor ID
/students/state/{state} : Get Students by State
/students/filter : Get Students by filters
/students/search : Get Students by search

/mentors : Get Mentors
/mentors/{mentor_id} : Get Mentor by ID
/mentors : Create Mentor
/mentors/{mentor_id} : Update Mentor
/mentors/{mentor_id} : Delete Mentor

/degrees : Get Degrees
/degrees/{degree_id} : Get Degree by ID
/degrees : Create Degree
/degrees/{degree_id} : Update Degree
/degrees/{degree_id} : Delete Degree

/classrooms : Get Classrooms
/classrooms/{classroom_id} : Get Classroom by ID
/classrooms : Create Classroom
/classrooms/{classroom_id} : Update Classroom
/classrooms/{classroom_id} : Delete Classroom

/courses : Get Courses
/courses/{course_id} : Get Course by ID

/attendances/{attendance_id} : Get Attendance by ID
/attendances : Create Attendance
/attendances/{attendance_id} : Update Attendance
/attendances/{attendance_id} : Delete Attendance

/payments : Get Payments
/payments/{payment_id} : Get Payment by ID
/payments : Create Payment
/payments/{payment_id} : Update Payment
/payments/{payment_id} : Delete Payment
/payments/student/{student_id} : Get Payments by Student ID
/payments/course/{course_id} : Get Payments by Course ID

I need a clean and modern user interface that allows me to manage the school system. I need a dashboard that allows me to manage the students, the mentors, the degrees, the classrooms, the courses, the attendances, and the payments.
The navigation should be intuitive and the UI should be clean and modern.
